# Mental-Health-in-Canada-Covid19
This project is an exploration of how mental health challenges in Canada have shifted throughout the COVID-19 pandemic using May 2020 survey data from CAMH/Delvinia. The jupyter notebook published here was originally a Kaggle notebook and was submitted as a task to the Roche Data Science Coalition's UNCOVER COVID-19 Challenge.

## Datasets
CAMH/Delvinia released two surveys and received responses from over 1000 Canadians for both surveys. The first survey was for May 8-12, 2020 and the second survey was for May 29-Jun 1, 2020. The aim of these surveys was to offer insight into the changing nature of Canadians' mental health and substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic. I did not collect this survey data - Delvinia is providing free access to the survey questions and results via its Methodify platform (delvinia.com/camh-coronavirus-mental-health/). I am not affiliated with CAMH or Delvinia in any way.

For both datasets (survey1_results.csv, survey2_results.csv), the first row contains the survey questions (1 question per column). Each succeeding row respresents the responses from one Canadian adult (18 years or older) that completed the survey.
